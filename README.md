# Function Approximator

There's a [theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem) that says that a feed-forward neural net with a single hidden layer containing a finite number of neurons can approximate continuous functions on compact subsets of **R**<sup>n</sup>. Here's a very simple Tensorflow implementation of just such a Universal Approximator.
